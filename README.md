# MangaDL
A Python script to crawl comic sites and extract chapters. Requires modifications to adapt to the specific links for each webpage. The script will write files to the script's current directory, and will place all images in their respective folder per chapter.

### Usage

* Modify the number of chapters to crawl
* Modify the target url to increment through each chapter
* (optional) Modify the image extension, should the comic be saved in a format other than .jpg 

### Plans

* Modify code to accept input for primary comic website and have it search for all links to chapters instead of manually modifying the number of chapters.
